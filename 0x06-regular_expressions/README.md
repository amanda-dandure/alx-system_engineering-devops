0x06. Regular expression

A regular expression (regex) is a pattern-matching language used to search and manipulate text. It is a powerful tool that can be used for various tasks such as validating input, extracting information, and replacing text. In the context of DevOps, regular expressions are often used in scripts and tools for automating tasks, configuring systems, and analyzing log data.

A regular expression consists of a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. For example, the regex \d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3} matches any IP address. Here, \d matches any digit, {1,3} specifies that the previous pattern should be repeated 1 to 3 times, and \. matches a dot.
